## Ripple Drum

The module 3 project guidelines required that we combine wireless communication with some kind of custom sensor. The idea I came up with was to place an array of five piezo sensors under the surface of a styrofoam drum. The sensors are arranged in a star pattern, meaning that when the surface is hit, the approximate position of the impact can be estimated by comparing the relative intensities registered by the individual sensors. This data is transmitted to a web page served by the ESP32, through websockets which acts as a visualization. The impact positions are turned into ripples on a virtual pond, almost like you were seeing the sound waves rippling on the drum's own surface.

The installation for this one is very simple, as all the relevant code is bundled into the single *ripple_pond.ino* arduino project. All that needs to be done is to load this program onto the ESP32. This will require that you have the *ESPAsyncWebServer* library installed, in order to support the websocket and http server. The *ripple.py* and *ripple.html* files are actaully redundant, because *ripple.html* is bundled within the ino, and the python file is just an early prototype to get a feel for the cellular automata wave propagation algorithm.
