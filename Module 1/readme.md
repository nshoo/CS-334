## Ant Colony: Installation
The ant colony simulation is relatively simple to get up and running, as the program is just a webpage designed to be run in a browser (preferably chrome). 

### Projector Setup
The first step that must be taken is to properly arrange the multiple screens so that the webpages will display correctly. The 6 screens in the Leeds studio are divided into two groups that both appear as separate (very large) displays. Navigate to the Windows display settings in order to make these changes. Once there, take the two large displays and make sure that they are set to "portrait" mode. You can do this by clicking on each of the displays in turn and selecting the option from the dropdown menu. Then, take the two large displays and stack them vertically, to the right of the main computer display. This means the projectors will be treated as effectively one very tall monitor sitting next to the main display. 

### Running the Program
With the projector set up, you're ready to run the program itself. It will require two separate browser windows to run, with one per big virtual display. To launch the program, simply open the file called `colony.html` twice, creating two identical windows. Drag the windows so that one appears on each of the large displays. Once they're in the right position, focus on each window in turn by clicking on it, and press the F11 key to make it fullscreen. Once this is done, everything should be working!

### Exiting the Program
Ending the program is as simple as closing out of the browser windows, and can be done multiple ways. One is to again select each window in turn, and press Ctrl-W, the shortcut for closing a browser tab. The easiest thing, however, is just to bring the cursor back to the main computer monitor so that you can see what you're doing. From there, simply right click on each window in the task bar, and select "close", which will have the same effect.
