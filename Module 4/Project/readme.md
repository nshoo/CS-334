## Salvador: the artist in a box

This directory contains the module 4 project code. For this one we were tasked with creating some sort of kinetic sculpture, or other interactive device that involved motors. I decided that I wanted to make a drawing robot that could create entirely new art pieces on the fly from a spoken prompt. Everything is controlled by a raspberry pi, which runs the python code found here. The program *main.py* imports everything, and hooks it all together. These scripts assume that all the files from the BrachioGraph repository (found here: "https://github.com/evildmp/BrachioGraph") have been downloaded, and placed in the same directory. Once, that's done, running the program is as simple as typing `python3 main.py`. It's important to bare in mind, though, that serveral APIs are called, and a key will need to be placed in the files containing a blank "API_KEY" slot.
