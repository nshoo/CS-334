## Motor lab

For this week's lab, we just had to make some motors turn with the ESP32. The ServoSweep.ino file, like the name suggests, sweeps a servo motor through its full 180 degreee range. Unfortunately, we encountered some problems with powering the stepper motor, namely that the only power supply we had access to was 12v and the steppers are only rated for 5v, so we weren't able to hook them up.
